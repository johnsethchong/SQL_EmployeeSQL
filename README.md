#Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

## Background

In this project, I will perform:

1. Data Modeling

2. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis

#### Data Modeling

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables at [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

#### Data Engineering

* Use the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
